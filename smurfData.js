  'description': 'Smurfette is a female Smurf who was created by Gargamel. She originally had black hair, though when Papa Smurf made her good, her hair became blonde. Before the smurflings created Sassette, Smurfette was the only female smurf in the Smurf village. Most of the time Smurfette is portrayed as an object of admiration of many other Smurfs, since she is the only female Smurf constantly in the village. She is usually hopeless in times of danger and sometimes thinks she knows it all, yet has a caring side as well.'

  'description': "Papa Smurf is the leader and elder of the Smurfs and can be easily distinguished by his red clothes and bushy white beard. The Smurfs turn to Papa Smurf when things go wrong. Papa Smurf is skilled in making magical spells and potions. He is much older than the other Smurfs (except for Grandpa and Nanny, who are older than Papa). Papa Smurf often serves the other Smurfs with his knowledge and wisdom and usually devises a plan for how to get out of trouble or to save the Smurf village from attacks by Gargamel. Unlike the other male Smurfs, Papa Smurf's trousers and hat are red instead of white."

  'description': "Hefty Smurf has incredible strength and often is seen doing a lot of the heavy work in the village. He also has a tattoo on his right arm (or sometimes both of his arms) of a red heart with an arrow through it. His favorite activity is lifting weights and doing other forms of exercise, and is often the one to kick Brainy out of the village whenever he is boasting. Hefty takes pride in being tough, sometimes doing it just for attention. Papa appoints Hefty as the leader of the Smurfs in season 3: Handy's Kite. In several episodes, Papa selects Hefty and Handy as leaders of separate teams in dangerous missions (season 1: Smurfette's Dancing Shoes; season 4: Hopping Cough Smurfs). In The Lost Village, he is one of the four main Smurf protagonists and is in love with Smurfette."

He can be distinguished from the others by the large glasses he wears. He also has archived his self-perceived wit and wisdom in several volumes of books entitled "The Quotations of Brainy Smurf". The Smurfs most often respond to his self-righteous preaching by either tossing him out of the village or clobbering him with a club (usually off screen). Most of the time, the other Smurfs never listen to him. His original name translates to "Smurf with Glasses".'

His catchphrase is "I hate (something somebody else mentions)" yet it is shown during the show that he is a good observer and notices kindness in others even if he is not playing active role in an event. Even though Grouchy Smurf portrays a role of a moaner within the group, he mostly wishes others to be happy and successful in order to get out of a problematic situation. Grouchy usually has a scowl on his face. In the comics version he was originally a normal Smurf, changed only when bitten by a Bzz fly in the comic story "The Black Smurfs" (adapted into English as "The Purple Smurfs"). In the cartoon version, he seems to have always have been a grouch. Despite his grouchiness, he has a soft spot for Baby Smurf and the Smurflings. In the movie, his grouchiness is implied to be from insecurity. In Movie 2, he tries to become Positive Smurf, but bad things keep happening to him.'

  'description': 'Weakling Smurf is a puny Smurf who tries to be athletic, but fails at all kinds of sports. When Hefty Smurf organizes Olympic Games (published in 1980), Weakling tries but fails to make an impact while in the training stage and decides to give up. Papa Smurf gives him a special potion that he says will enable him to compete. Weakling proceeds to win every contest he enters but, on being awarded his medal, confesses that he cheated. Papa Smurf then reveals that his potion was nothing more than a form of harmless jam that he gave to Weakling in order to boost his morale, meaning that Weakling did win the Games on his own merit.'
